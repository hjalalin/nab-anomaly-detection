# Notebooks

This directory contains notebooks organized by dataset source.  
Each folder represents a separate time series subject and includes exploration, modeling, and evaluation steps.

## Folder Structure

### `machine_temperature/`
- Time series of industrial machine temperature from the NAB dataset
- Focused on LSTM-based anomaly detection and trend detection

## Topics Covered

- Data exploration and visualization
- Classical anomaly detection methods
- Machine learning & unsupervised models
- LSTM and deep learning-based detection
- Trend detection and rolling statistics
- Model evaluation and comparison


> Each folder is self-contained and serves as a mini-project for a specific dataset type.
